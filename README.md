# Python script that fetches data from the Pokédex API and categorizes the retrieved Pokémon based on certain criteria.

* Install the requests library if you haven't already using pip install requests.

Here's how the script works:

We define two functions:
* fetch_pokemon_data to fetch data for a specific Pokémon from the Pokédex API,
* and categorize_pokemon_by_type to categorize Pokémon based on their types.
* In the main function, we specify a list of Pokémon names to fetch data for. You can modify this list as needed.
* We iterate through the Pokémon names, fetch data for each Pokémon, and categorize them based on their types.
* Finally, we display the results by printing the Pokémon categories along with the names of Pokémon belonging to each category.
